# How do we track the valid ship combinations?
# Idea: Have an array? 2D?

# Check for midpoint

# Move ships after each photo

'''
Your program should guess the “midpoint”. The midpoint is a bit unusual in this
problem. At each time the photo is taken there is a list of possible locations that the ship could
be (based on the speed/location combinations that have not been invalidated).
'''


# First photo is exactly 1 hour after distress signal
# The ship will move for 1 hour after the last picture
# After a certain point, you're taking pictures after the boat has passed. You're trying to catch up to it.
def solve(S: int, L: int):

    numberPictures: int = 24


    # At 0, no pics have been taken; boat will be at starting position.
    # If our HI is maxStartPos + maxSpeed, then we cover the max range that the boat could be in during our first photo
