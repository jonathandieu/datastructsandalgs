**Data Structure Used**: Queue

**Runtime:**
- O(n) where n = number of nodes
- O(|V| + |E|)

**Description:** Traverse a graph by *level* such that given a root node, you add visit each of its neighbors and add them to a queue before continuing through the rest of the graphs.

**Uses:**
- Finding the shortest path
- Level order traversal of a tree data structure
