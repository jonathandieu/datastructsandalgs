    Problem: Given a target number and a list of numbers, return a list of indices of numbers that add up to the target number.
    Solution: Iterate through the list of nums and subtract the target from each number and save it in the hash map for reference.
    Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of items in the list we must iterate through.
